This project was copied from: https://codepen.io/drewcurley/pen/PoeYVrJ



### The Task

Create a pizza calculator app that is mobile and desktop friendly.



### Criteria

* For any number of pizzas (the user can add more), there will be a label (e.g. pizza 1), and the user should input a diameter and a price.
* If the user inputs invalid data, the program should let them know.
* The user should be able to remove any pizzas on screen.
* The pizzas should automatically increment their label, and that label should decrease when pizzas are removed.
* When a calculate button is pressed, the app should determine which pizza is the best value and distinguish it as such.
* If a best value is determined, and another pizza is added, the best value indicator should be removed automatically.
